- Adhering to programming standards - Programming design principles, such as: -
- Single Responsibility Principle 
- Open/Closed Principle 
- Liskov Substitution Principle 
- Interface Segregation Principle 
- Dependency Inversion Principle
- Design patterns, including: -
1. Creational patterns
2. Structural patterns 
3. Behavioral patterns 
4. Enhancing code readability through effective naming

- Testing concepts, like: - 
- End-to-end (E2E) testing - Unit testing - Managing time efficiently - Strategically pacing project development --- It's important to recognise that everything I present here is just a guideline, not a rule. I call them "sins" but in reality, there's exceptions to everything. I think all of the points mentioned in the video could misused, if you're not careful. I've seen people who over-engineer simple codebases to the point it's unreadable, just to have a fully modular codebase; or obsess over perfectly following standards, even when it becomes incompatible in certain situations; or spending way too much time trying to achieve 100% test coverage, when it added no more benefit to do so. The best way to interpret this video is to have a little understanding of the topics, and choose the things that you want to learn more about. This is not a doctrine in any way, just some tips to kickstart more knowledge and understanding. Everything mentioned in the video once had a pain point behind it that will have led to its creation, but maybe you don't have these same pain points... yet! Just remember the potential solutions for when you do, or use them as a foundation for your own exploration! --- (longer description) Are you ready to level up your coding skills and avoid the seven deadly sins of programming? In this video, we'll explore common mistakes made by developers and how to fix them, leading to better code quality and more readable code. Join us as we dive into programming standards and the importance of consistency in file structure, whitespace, and coding philosophies. Learn about SOLID principles, a set of design principles that will help you write maintainable, scalable, reusable, and testable code. We'll also discuss programming design patterns and how they can serve as a universal vocabulary for better understanding your code. Discover the importance of using descriptive names in your code and explore various testing methods, from end-to-end testing to unit and integration tests. We'll also touch upon time management, emphasizing the need to provide accurate estimates and avoid rushing through projects.
