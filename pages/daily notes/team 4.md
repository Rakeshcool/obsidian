## UNION
let G1(V1,E1) & G2(V2,E2) be two graphs then union of G1 & G2 is a graph G = G1 U G2 where vertex set V=V1 U V2 and edge set

in simple words,
if we have 2 graphs given as g1 and g2 and we are performing union operation then the resultant graph (G) 
 which is going to be created will having vertex and edges in those elements  and now if we do the union  of V1 and V2 and same thing we do with edges E=E1 U E2 so the resultant edges which we get will be of resultant graph

 the graph union operation is very much similar to the concept of set theory

 ## intersection

let G1(V1,V2) AND G2(V2,E1) Be two graphs then the interaction  of  G1 AND G2 is  a graph G = G1 ∩ G2 whose vertex set V= V1 ∩ V2 and edge set E=E1∩ E2

in simple words,we have to do intersection of both edges and vertex
