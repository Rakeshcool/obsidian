I was happy being rude... I neglected your calls with a swift mood... I wanted to make you feel miserable so that you'll feel the pain... IÂ  left you in agony with a confused brain... I didn't want you to be special, i left you in vain cuz I'm a greedy person With so much pain i was going to die before you even know... I wanted you to be with someone better so i left you alone...
