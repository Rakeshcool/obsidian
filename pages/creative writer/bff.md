At this point you might be thinking what do mean by girl-friend, you can see the dash right it well  means she is one step away from becoming my girlfriend well not really it is just a friendship we are going to  talk  about or is it something more than that well I don't know you guys can decide for yourself.

Remember buddy whom I talked about previously well he happens to get acquainted to this girl as  she was one of the girls which were on his flirt list. As days goes by buddy was really trying his best efforts to know this girl by chatting or talking whatever will help him to get closer.

few days passed by buddy was still struggling to get her proper attention, for the time being lets call her by an alias name kanojo. So kanojo was not really taking the bait from my buddy and thus our author came into the picture.

One day author was going with buddy talking about how school life is going on, author did not realize  that now they are moving in the same direction as of kanojo .Our flirt guy again started his business of useless flirting and from there in that nick of conversation kanojo asked the author hello what's your name and thus begins the story of author and kanojo.

As our author was not so good at upfront conversation but surprisingly he was really good at chatting which he also came to realize later. As time went by author and kanojo get really close so much that my friend buddy was starting to ask me strange question like is she online why is she not replying to my text and all author said at that point is that you don't know how to hold a conversation, all you do is flirting  may be that's the reason she is not chatting with you.

  

The girl was really a kind soul she helped the author overcoming the fear of not so friendly, as days pass by they shared each other memories and secrets and their normal friendship changed into something different yep you are right a special bond popular among the teenager which is  best friend or bestie. Author was really surprised by the fact that somebody is  considering him as a best friend because in his past life the best friend he ever called someone never called him back that yeah author is my best friend. It was kind of new for him that now he is also precious to somebody as one day he was in his bad mood for some reason her bestie mood also get effected which he find quite adoring as she really meant him to be his bestie.

Slowly Author was making progress in making new friends and with them he started spending good times. All this started because of her one interruption on the road and suddenly now he is friends with all her close friends.
