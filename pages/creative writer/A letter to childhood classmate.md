Jo dil ke pass hota hai wahi sabse khas hota hai  
Mujhe Nahi ata.. keh ke wo eh sas jagana  
Mujhe Nahi ata.. Keh ke wo ehsas jagana  
  
  
Baatein toh sabhi kar letay hai kabhi toh isare samjhein  
Iss.. na chiz ko kabhi toh apna samjhe  
  
  
I won't call you unless it's quite important to me... But you can call me no matter how small the topic can be... Just do it  
  
  
It's been 5 yrs since we became friends.... We knew each other from childhood but never got to know each other because we both are of the same type...
