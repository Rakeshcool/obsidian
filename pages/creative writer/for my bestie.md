Like a ray of light you came into my life  
  
Filling all the black strides making it all white  
  
like a symphony it all came  
  
Making those wondrous sounds that it all rang  
  
You touched my heart and mended it like no other  
  
Just like a lake your words flow  
  
Slow but gentle like a dying snow  
  
You bring joy to my life  
  
Your smile make this life  
a little bit right  
  
I have found you to be like no other  
  
You are like a shining jem to my whole life  
  
I'm grateful to you  
  
My dear friend  
My dear friend  
My dear friend ...
